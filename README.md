1. Fork this repository to your own account.
2. Clone *your personal* fork.

4. As you complete each challenge, submit a pull request.

### Challenge 1
**Merge a branch with master**

Simply merge the branch "mergeme" with master.

### Challenge 2
**Find the commit that broke master**

Inside the master branch, you'll find a script called *broken.sh*. One of the commits broke this script. You'll need to find the commit ID! Add that commit ID to a new file called "broken.txt".

There is a branch called "rebaseme". Add it to master without using `git merge`.
